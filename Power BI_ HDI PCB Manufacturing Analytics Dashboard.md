## ⚠️ Important Note on Data Source

The dataset used for this project is **100% synthetic and was generated by an AI model** to simulate a realistic PCB manufacturing environment. The primary goal was to create a functional, end-to-end Power BI project for learning and demonstration purposes, from data modeling to final visualization, without relying on publicly available (but often overused) datasets.

This approach allowed for the creation of a unique and complex dataset tailored to the specific analytical needs of a manufacturing dashboard. While the data is synthetic, the business logic, data model, DAX measures, and analytical approach are all production-ready and reflect real-world business intelligence best practices.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Project Objectives
- To build a comprehensive, end-to-end Power BI dashboard from scratch.
- To demonstrate proficiency in data modeling, DAX, and visualization.
- To create a portfolio-worthy project using a unique, AI-generated dataset.
- To analyze financial, quality, and operational data to derive actionable business insights.

### Data Model
A classic star schema was implemented to ensure efficient querying and scalability. 

- **Fact Tables:** `fact_production`, `fact_maintenance`
- **Dimension Tables:** `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `dim_material`, `dim_machine`, and a custom `Date Table` created with DAX.
- **Relationships:** One-to-many relationships were established from dimension tables to fact tables. The `Date Table` is connected to both `fact_production` (on `order_date`) and `fact_maintenance` (on `maintenance_date`).

### Key DAX Measures
Over 15 DAX measures were created to power the dashboard's visuals. Key measures include:

**Financial Metrics:**
```dax
Total Revenue = SUM(Production[sales_price_per_board_usd] * Production[quantity_shipped])

Total Cost = SUM(Production[material_cost_usd] + Production[labor_cost_usd] + Production[maintenance_cost_usd])

Total Profit = [Total Revenue] - [Total Cost]

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)

YoY Revenue Growth % = 
VAR CurrentYearRevenue = [Total Revenue]
VAR PreviousYearRevenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date Table'[Date]))
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentYearRevenue - PreviousYearRevenue, PreviousYearRevenue, 0)
```

**Quality Metrics:**
```dax
Scrap Rate % = DIVIDE(SUM(Production[scrapped_units]), SUM(Production[units_produced]), 0)
```

**Operational Metrics:**
```dax
Total Maintenance Cost = SUM(Maintenance[Labor Cost USD]) + SUM(Maintenance[Parts Cost USD])

Total Breakdowns = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Maintenance), Maintenance[Maintenance Type] IN {"Emergency", "Corrective"})

Breakdown Rate % = DIVIDE([Total Breakdowns], COUNTROWS(Maintenance), 0)
```

### Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, DAX measure creation, and report visualization.
- **PostgreSQL:** The source relational database for the raw data.
- **DAX Studio:** Used for optimizing and debugging complex DAX measures.
- **AI (ChatGPT/LLM):** Used for generating the synthetic dataset.
